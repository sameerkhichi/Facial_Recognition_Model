# 🔐 Face Authentication with Siamese Networks

This project implements a **Siamese Neural Network** in TensorFlow for real-time face authentication.  
It allows you to compare a live webcam feed against a set of stored images to verify identity.

---

## 🚀 Features
- Train a Siamese network from scratch using anchor, positive, and negative image sets  
- Save & load trained models (`.h5` or `.keras`)  
- Evaluate model accuracy with visualization of predictions  
- Live webcam verification with OpenCV overlay results
