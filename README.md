# üîê Face Authentication with Siamese Networks

This project implements a **Siamese Neural Network** in TensorFlow for real-time face authentication.  
It allows you to compare a live webcam feed against a set of stored images to verify identity.

---

## üöÄ Features
- Train a Siamese network from scratch using anchor, positive, and negative image sets  
- Save & load trained models (`.h5` or `.keras`)  
- Evaluate model accuracy with visualization of predictions  
- Live webcam verification with OpenCV overlay results

## Application Installation

To download the application visit: https://github.com/sameerkhichi/Facial_Recognition_Model/releases/tag/v1.0.0

Click the FaceID.zip file to start the download
Unzip the folder and double-click on the FaceID application
Note that console was left on to view progress and background work, so the command prompt will open with the app.
