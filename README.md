# 🔐 Face Authentication with Siamese Networks

This project implements a **Siamese Neural Network** in TensorFlow for real-time face authentication.  
It allows you to compare a live webcam feed against a set of stored images to verify identity.

---

## 🚀 Features
- Train a Siamese network from scratch using anchor, positive, and negative image sets  
- Save & load trained models (`.h5` or `.keras`)  
- Evaluate model accuracy with visualization of predictions  
- Live webcam verification with OpenCV overlay results

## Application Installation

To download the application visit: https://github.com/sameerkhichi/Facial_Recognition_Model/releases/tag/v1.0.0

- Click the FaceID.zip file to start the download
- Unzip the folder and double-click on the FaceID application
- A warning will pop up, and this is due to the lack of purchase of a license. Click 'more info' and run anyway.
- The first start-up will take a few moments, so please be patient. The app will start within 20 seconds of launching it
- Note that console was left on to view progress and background work, so the command prompt will open with the app.
